# Weather-Dashboard
## Description
This is a weather dashboard that allows you to search for the weather in a particular city. The dashboard then displays the current weather conditions as well as a 5 day forecast. The app keeps a running list of the last 5 searched cities which you can click and see the weather conditions for that city again. As a new city is searched over 5, the item at the end of the search list is removed.
